    <h1>Welcome to Gharzai Brand</h1>

    <p>
        Gharzai presents a new collection of handmade clothing, created with care and tradition
        by Afghan women working from their homes. Each piece reflects generations of craftsmanship,
        cultural heritage, and the unique artistry of Afghan handwork.
    </p>

    <p>
        Gharzai Brand is more than fashion — it is a source of income and independence for widowed women
        and women who are the heads of their households. Through home-based businesses, these women are
        able to support their families with dignity, using their skills in embroidery, stitching, and
        traditional textile design.
    </p>

    <p>
        Gharzai provides a safe and supportive platform where women do not have to search for customers
        on their own. Instead, the brand connects their handmade clothing to a wider market, allowing
        their work to be seen, valued, and appreciated.
