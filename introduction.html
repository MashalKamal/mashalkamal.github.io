        <p>
            I’m currently studying Computer Science at UNC Charlotte, focusing on Software Engineering and Web/Mobile App Development. I love diving into new backend technologies and frameworks, and I’m excited to see how I can apply what I've learned to real-world projects.
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Background</h2>
        <p>
            I'm 20 years old, and when I'm not studying, you can usually find me at home enjoying the delicious meals I make.
        </p>

        <h2>Professional Background</h2>
        <p>
            Right now, I’m interning in the IT department at CPCC, where I’m gaining hands-on experience while taking my classes at UNC Charlotte.
        </p>

        <h2>Academic Background</h2>
        <p>
            I graduated from CPCC, and I’m now a junior, eager to expand my knowledge and skills in the tech world.
        </p>

        <h2>Background in Subject</h2>
        <p>
            I’ve taken computer classes and learned coding, but this is my first time with web development classes, which honestly makes me a bit nervous.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Work Setup</h2>
        <p>
            My main workhorse is a 2023 HP. If anything goes wrong, I have all my information saved in a folder, and I back up my data every month.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Courses</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>ITIS3135 - Front-End Web Application Development</li>
            <li>ITSC3160 - Database Design & Implementation</li>
            <li>STAT2122 - Introduction to Probability and Statistics</li>
        </ul>
